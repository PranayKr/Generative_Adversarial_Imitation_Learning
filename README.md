# Implementation of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm for replicating the recorded behavior of an expert in the context of the Atari Breakout Game (Breakout-V0 Open AI Gym environment)
# Problem Statement Description
Breakout-V0 is an Open-AI Gym Environment in which the paddle agent needs to :
A) Hit a ball towards a brick wall and acquires points ( +1 for every hit per brick)
B) Not miss hitting the ball once it rebounds ,otherwise it loses life . The agent has a total of 5 lives . Losing all the lives leads to termination of the game and the games then resets to initial state .
